# Connect Four

By Julia Yi

#### Premise:
Connect Four is a two-player game in which each player takes turns dropping a colored disc into a 6 x 7 grid. Each disc is dropped down the grid and the pieces are stacked vertically over time. 

#### Objective: 
The objective of the game is to place four discs in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally, while trying to block the other player from doing the same.

#### How to Win:
The first player to place four of their discs in a row wins the game. If the entire grid has been filled and neither player has placed four consecutive discs, the game is tied.
