# Connect Four

By Julia Yi

#### Premise:
Connect Four is a two-player game in which each player takes turns dropping a colored disc into a 6 x 7 grid. Each disc is dropped down the grid and the pieces are stacked vertically over time. 

#### Objective: 
The objective of the game is to place four discs in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally, while trying to block the other player from doing the same.

#### How to Win:
The first player to place four of their discs in a row wins the game. If the entire grid has been filled and neither player has placed four consecutive discs, the game is tied.

## Next Steps

In order to improve my game, I would add the following features:

1. Animations to show discs sliding down a column
2. Sound of discs stacking over the course of the game
3. Score keeper to keep track of wins and losses
4. Ability to play against the computer
5. Choice of difficulty level when playing against the computer
5. Customizable disc colors
